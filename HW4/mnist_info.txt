1. Title: MNIST database of handwritten digits

2. Description:
Dataset of 10,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 60,000 images.

3. Format:
Use the following R commands to restore the data in R

load("mnist.Rdata")
objects()

You will now have access to the following objects:
x_train      an array of grayscale image data for training with dimension (10,000, 28, 28)
y_train      an array of digit labels (integers in the range of 0-9) with length (10,000). 
x_test       an array of grayscale image data for testing with dimension (60,000, 28, 28)
y_test       an array of digit labels (integers in the range of 0-9) with length (60,000).

Then follow the steps in Lab 10 to preprocess the data so you can fit SVM and NN models.
